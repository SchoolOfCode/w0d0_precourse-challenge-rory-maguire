# Tribute to the Lakes

<p>Originally I created a tribute page for the legendary Freddie Mercury of Queen, but I didn't want to get into trouble for using images I stole off Google- no good royalty free images available.

<p>I created a tribute page dedicated to the Lake District and I was happy to be able to use my own photos that I took back in March/April 2021. I was trying to practice background and image skills in css but found it quite tricky because of wanting full image size etc not ideal, silly me.

<p>I loved the idea of having full-size images cascading down the page with blocks of text and captions dotted around too- a downside to this could be the time it takes to render the images if someone tried to reach the website.

<p>To learn the CSS and HTML skills, I watched the 11.5hr video full course from freecodecamp on YT. This video was really great and I consolidated this with regular visits to W3 Schools, Mozilla and Stack Overflow, aswell as other youtubers who I found to be really helful like Traversy Media and Kevin Powell.

<p> Sometimes I found myself a little stuck and randomly guessing code that could produce the result I wanted, but really when I took a step back and thought about what exactly I wanted, it became easier to sculpt the result.

<p> Aside from this I have found this very enjoyable and really would like for these skills to become instinctive and maybe I could become faster and more concise, and of course be able to do more things!
