        <p>I have been visting the Lake District since the age of about
        4 years old and have many warm memories of this beautiful 
        part of the world. I've always loved putting on the walking boots
        and spending the day out in the beautiful fells with the 
        family and our two dogs. The evening before each day you 
        can lay out a map and choose which route 
        you're going to walk. Like many other people, I've developed 
        a true love for the Lake District and the outdoors in general, 
        thanks to the time spent here. I find it to be a great place to escape and get peace of mind.</p>

    <h3>William Wordsworth</h3>
    <p>The Lake District was the subject of many of
    <a target="blank" id='link2' href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>'s poems, his publications sparked off the beginnings of much of the tourism to the area at the beginning of the 19th century. I personally really love this particular poem of his as I think it captures a really sentiment. Enjoy!</p>
   <h3>'I Wondered Lonely as a Cloud'- William Wordsworth</h3>
    <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud
                That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
                When all at once I saw a crowd,
                A host, of golden daffodils;
                Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
                Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.</p>
                <p>Continuous as the stars that shine
                And twinkle on the milky way,
                They stretched in never-ending line
                Along the margin of a bay:
                Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
                Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.</p>
                <p> The waves beside them danced; but they
                Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
                A poet could not but be gay,
                In such a jocund company:
                I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
                What wealth the show to me had brought:</p>
                <p>For oft, when on my couch I lie
                In vacant or in pensive mood,
                They flash upon that inward eye
                Which is the bliss of solitude;
                And then my heart with pleasure fills,
                And dances with the daffodils.
